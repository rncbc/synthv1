0.9.2  2018-07-24  A Summer'18 release.

- Add LV2 UI Resize extension data support.

  place, as a baseline for any micro-tuning implementations.
- Whether to use native file browser/requester dialogs is

- A little hardening on the configure (autoconf) macro side.


0.8.6  2017-12-20  The End of Autumn'17 release.

- Sync option added to DCO wavetable oscillators, as for
  making either one to hard-sync (slave) with the other

  audible clicking on low-pitched notes.


0.8.5  2017-10-29  An Autumn'17 release.

  the preset drop-down listing, while only the first one is

  from all build/configure template chains, whatever.

- Long overdue, some brand new and fundamental icons revamp.


0.8.2  2017-05-02  Pre-LAC2017 release frenzy.

- A custom knob/spin-box behavioral option have been added:
  Configure/Knob edit mode, as to avoid abrupt changes upon
  editing values (still the default behavior) and only take
  effect (Deferred) when enter is pressed or the spin-box
  loses focus.
- The main GUI has been partially revamped, after replacing
  some rotary knob/dial combos with kinda more skeuomorphic
  fake-LED radio-buttons or check-boxes.
- Alias-free/band-limited wavetable oscillators have been
  fixed to prevent cross-octave, polyphonic interference.
- A MIDI In(put) status fake-LED is now featured on the
  bottom-left status bar, adding up to eye-candy as usual.

- Fixed a probable old miss about changing spin-box and
  drop-down list not reflecting changes immediately into
  the respective parameter dial knobs.

  to the current default parameter value.
- Help/Configure.../Options/Use desktop environment native
  dialogs option is now set initially off by default.
- Added French man page (by Olivier Humbert, thanks).
- Make builds reproducible byte for byte, by getting rid of
  the configure build date and time stamps.


0.8.0  2016-11-17  A Fall'16 release.

- LV2_STATE__StateChanged is now transmitted as a regular
  atom notification event, as far as to give some careful
  hosts enough slack to raise a dirty flag.
- Fixed input MIDI RPN/NRPN running status processing.
- Almost complete overhaul on the configure script command
  line options, wrt. installation directories specification,
  eg. --prefix, --bindir, --libdir, --datadir and --mandir.


0.7.6  2016-09-19  The Eleventh official beta.

- MIDI RPN/NRPN running status and RPN NULL reset command
  are now supported (input only).
- The core engine implementation is now delivered as a shared
  object library, common to both the JACK stand-alone client
  and the LV2 instrument plug-in.
- Discretely fixed MIDI Controlllers catch-up algorithm.


0.7.5  2016-06-16  The Tenth official beta.

- All changes to most continuous parameter values are now
  smoothed to a fast but finite slew rate.
- All BPM sync options to current transport (Auto) have been
  refactored to new special minimum value (which is now zero).
- In compliance to the LV2 spec. MIDI Controllers now affect
  cached parameter values only, via shadow ports, instead of
  input control ports directly, mitigating their read-only
  restriction.
- Make sure LV2 plug-in state is properly reset on restore.
- Dropped the --enable-qt5 from configure as found redundant
  given that's the build default anyway (suggestion by Guido
  Scholz, while for Qtractor, thanks).


0.7.4  2016-03-02  The ninth-bis official beta.

- Fixed the DCF Formant filter voice initialization reset.


0.7.3  2016-02-22  The ninth official beta.

- Avoid out-of-bound MIDI events as much as possible, coping
  with LV2 plug-in hosts that feed/run them in on border line
  circumstances (as reported by Thorsten Wilms, on suspected
  Ardour looping crash/bug, probably fixed already, thanks).
- Safe defaults are tentatively sbeing introduced to internal
  OUT FX buffer-sizes, as read from JACK buffer-size changes
  and LV2 block-length instantiation bound options.
- Added application keywords to freedesktop.org's AppData.


0.7.2  2015-12-04  The eighth official beta.

- A brand new LFO BPM control parameter is being introduced,
  as a subordinate to LFO Rate, with follow/sync to current
  transport/host option (BPM=Auto).
- LFO Sync (free running) mode option has been introduced.
- A fourth DCF type has been added: a vocal Formant filter.
- A third DCF slope/type has been added: the RBJ's bi-quad.
- Prefer Qt5 over Qt4 by default with configure script.
- Introducing brand new OUT FX Send parameter per engine.

0.7.0  2015-07-24  A seventh official beta.

- Reset ramps after LV2 control port reconnection; small fixes
  to LV2.ttl (pull-requests by Hanspeter Portner aka. ventosus,
  thanks).
- MIDI Controllers/Programs is now an optional feature on the
  LV2 plugin forms, as some LV2 hosts might enforce the purity
  restriction to input control ports as being absolutely read-
  only parameter values from a plugin's instance perspective.
- MIDI Controller mapping/learn is now possible on all parameter
  control knobs; with global configuration also avaiable on the
  Help/Configure dialog.
- French (fr) translation line to desktop file added (by Olivier
  Humbert, thanks).


0.6.3  2015-05-09  A sixth official beta.

- Main widget layout changed as much to expand or grow vertically
  as needed.


0.6.2  2015-04-30  A fifth official beta.

- Custom knob/dial behavior mode options are now introduced:
  linear and angular (aka. radial) as far to avoid abrupt
  changes on first mouse click (still the default behavior).
- Fixed for some strict tests for Qt4 vs. Qt5 configure builds.


0.6.1  2015-03-09  A fourth official beta.

- Added application description as freedesktop.org's AppData.
- Introducing LV2 port-groups (as proposed by Amadeus Folego aka.
  badosu, thanks).
- Improved envelope widget nodes click-and-drag precision.
- Introducing a brand new user preference on eye-candy: cf.Help
  /Configure.../Options/Custom style theme (applies to the JACK
  stand-alone client only though).
- Envelope and filter now rendered with anti-aliased lines.
- Fixed a Qt5 FTBFS re. QHeaderView::set[Section]ResizeMode().


0.6.0  2014-01-23  A third official beta.

- MIDI bank-select/program-changes is now supported, for patch,
  preset and/or instrument program control.
- New Help/Configure dialog is introduced for editing the also
  new MIDI bank/programs interface and user preference options
  as well (new home of the old Help/Use native dialogs option).
- Presets may now be specified by base name, as an alternative
  to the complete preset file-path on command line argument (re.
  stand-alone JACK client).

0.5.1  2014-09-12  One second official beta.

- One decimal digit added to all scalar parameters and knobs.
- Stand-alone JACK client ports outrageously renamed from a

- Disable band-limit option for 'Noise' oscillator wave-shapes.
- Allow the build system to include an user specified LDFLAGS.


0.4.2  2014-04-29  A pre-LAC frenzy beta.

- Badly named 'Noise' wave-shape oscillators get their band-
  limited treat option and re-labeled as 'Rand'; also a brand
  new wave-shape 'Noise' is then introduced (now for real :)).
- New user preference option, cf. Help/Use native dialogs.
- An anti-denormal regression applied to the Phaser fx stage
  (affecting early proto-beta >= 0.4.0).


0.4.1  2014-04-07  A proto-beta bis.

- Once so called 'Noise' wave-shapes are now being made a lot
  more deterministic, read idempotent ;).
- Fully alias-free/band-limited wavetable oscillators are now
  in place, making it a better virtual-analog synthesizer (esp.
  for running sample-rates below 96KHz).
- Late optimizations to basic wave-table oscillators.
- Make sure the LV2 plugin back-end always builds first, before
  its respective LV2 UI front-end client.


0.4.0  2014-03-06  A proto-beta party.

- All knobs default value setting slightly improved.
- A run-time circumvention have been hacked, strictly related
  to when NSM session management is in charge: the native file
  browser/requester dialogs are then disabled (were taking too
  long to list the current directory on first time invocation).

  LV2 plugin, whether it may be .../lib or .../lib64 on bi
  -arch targets, when libdir is not specified on configure
  time (--libdir=LIBDIR).

  master lesson taught by Jarle Richard Akselsen, thanks.


0.3.3  2013-05-31  Late spring blossoming

- Some sympathy to extreme dark color (read black) schemes is
  now being indulged; some discrete changes on the icon front
  has also emerged ;)

  recognized, in addition to MIDI channel pressure/aftertouch
  processing.
- Parameter value ramping moved into the late post-processing,
  an attempt to reduce some pop/click artifacts even further.

- Preparations for Qt5 migration.


0.3.0  2012-12-21  Third coming release.
