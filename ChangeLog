  Configure/Knob edit mode, as to avoid abrupt changes upon
  editing values (still the default behavior) and only take
  effect (Deferred) when enter is pressed or the spin-box
  loses focus.
- The main GUI has been partially revamped, after replacing
  some rotary knob/dial combos with kinda more skeuomorphic
  fake-LED radio-buttons or check-boxes.
- Alias-free/band-limited wavetable oscillators have been
  fixed to prevent cross-octave, polyphonic interference.
- A MIDI In(put) status fake-LED is now featured on the
  bottom-left status bar, adding up to eye-candy as usual.

  to the current default parameter value.
- Help/Configure.../Options/Use desktop environment native
  dialogs option is now set initially off by default.
- Added French man page (by Olivier Humbert, thanks).
- Make builds reproducible byte for byte, by getting rid of
  the configure build date and time stamps.


0.8.0  2016-11-17  A Fall'16 release.

- LV2_STATE__StateChanged is now transmitted as a regular
  atom notification event, as far as to give some careful
  hosts enough slack to raise a dirty flag.

- Almost complete overhaul on the configure script command
  line options, wrt. installation directories specification,
  eg. --prefix, --bindir, --libdir, --datadir and --mandir.

- MIDI RPN/NRPN running status and RPN NULL reset command
  are now supported (input only).

  object library, common to both the JACK stand-alone client
  and the LV2 instrument plug-in.

0.7.5  2016-06-16  The Tenth official beta.

- All changes to most continuous parameter values are now
  smoothed to a fast but finite slew rate.
- All BPM sync options to current transport (Auto) have been
  refactored to new special minimum value (which is now zero).
- In compliance to the LV2 spec. MIDI Controllers now affect
  cached parameter values only, via shadow ports, instead of
  input control ports directly, mitigating their read-only
  restriction.
- Make sure LV2 plug-in state is properly reset on restore.
- Dropped the --enable-qt5 from configure as found redundant
  given that's the build default anyway (suggestion by Guido
  Scholz, while for Qtractor, thanks).

- Fixed the DCF Formant filter voice initialization reset.


0.7.3  2016-02-22  The ninth official beta.

- Avoid out-of-bound MIDI events as much as possible, coping
  with LV2 plug-in hosts that feed/run them in on border line
  circumstances (as reported by Thorsten Wilms, on suspected
  Ardour looping crash/bug, probably fixed already, thanks).
- Safe defaults are tentatively sbeing introduced to internal
  OUT FX buffer-sizes, as read from JACK buffer-size changes
  and LV2 block-length instantiation bound options.
- Added application keywords to freedesktop.org's AppData.


0.7.2  2015-12-04  The eighth official beta.

- A brand new LFO BPM control parameter is being introduced,
  as a subordinate to LFO Rate, with follow/sync to current
  transport/host option (BPM=Auto).
- LFO Sync (free running) mode option has been introduced.
- A fourth DCF type has been added: a vocal Formant filter.
- A third DCF slope/type has been added: the RBJ's bi-quad.
- Prefer Qt5 over Qt4 by default with configure script.

- Reset ramps after LV2 control port reconnection; small fixes
  to LV2.ttl (pull-requests by Hanspeter Portner aka. ventosus,
  thanks).
- MIDI Controllers/Programs is now an optional feature on the
  LV2 plugin forms, as some LV2 hosts might enforce the purity
  restriction to input control ports as being absolutely read-
  only parameter values from a plugin's instance perspective.
- MIDI Controller mapping/learn is now possible on all parameter
  control knobs; with global configuration also avaiable on the
  Help/Configure dialog.
- French (fr) translation line to desktop file added (by Olivier
  Humbert, thanks).


0.6.3  2015-05-09  A sixth official beta.

- Main widget layout changed as much to expand or grow vertically
  as needed.


0.6.2  2015-04-30  A fifth official beta.

- Custom knob/dial behavior mode options are now introduced:
  linear and angular (aka. radial) as far to avoid abrupt
  changes on first mouse click (still the default behavior).
- Fixed for some strict tests for Qt4 vs. Qt5 configure builds.


0.6.1  2015-03-09  A fourth official beta.

- Added application description as freedesktop.org's AppData.
- Introducing LV2 port-groups (as proposed by Amadeus Folego aka.
  badosu, thanks).
- Improved envelope widget nodes click-and-drag precision.
- Introducing a brand new user preference on eye-candy: cf.Help
  /Configure.../Options/Custom style theme (applies to the JACK
  stand-alone client only though).
- Envelope and filter now rendered with anti-aliased lines.
- Fixed a Qt5 FTBFS re. QHeaderView::set[Section]ResizeMode().


0.6.0  2014-01-23  A third official beta.

- MIDI bank-select/program-changes is now supported, for patch,
  preset and/or instrument program control.
- New Help/Configure dialog is introduced for editing the also
  new MIDI bank/programs interface and user preference options
  as well (new home of the old Help/Use native dialogs option).
- Presets may now be specified by base name, as an alternative
  to the complete preset file-path on command line argument (re.
  stand-alone JACK client).

  limited treat option and re-labeled as 'Rand'; also a brand
  new wave-shape 'Noise' is then introduced (now for real :)).
- New user preference option, cf. Help/Use native dialogs.
- An anti-denormal regression applied to the Phaser fx stage
  (affecting early proto-beta >= 0.4.0).


0.4.1  2014-04-07  A proto-beta bis.

- Once so called 'Noise' wave-shapes are now being made a lot
  more deterministic, read idempotent ;).
- Fully alias-free/band-limited wavetable oscillators are now
  in place, making it a better virtual-analog synthesizer (esp.
  for running sample-rates below 96KHz).
- Late optimizations to basic wave-table oscillators.

  its respective LV2 UI front-end client.


0.4.0  2014-03-06  A proto-beta party.

- All knobs default value setting slightly improved.

  to when NSM session management is in charge: the native file
  browser/requester dialogs are then disabled (were taking too
  long to list the current directory on first time invocation).

- Some sympathy to extreme dark color (read black) schemes is
  now being indulged; some discrete changes on the icon front
  has also emerged ;)
