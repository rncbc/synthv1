synthv1 - an old-school polyphonic synthesizer
----------------------------------------------

ChangeLog

SVN TRUNK

- Fully alias-free/band-limited wavetable oscillators are now
  in place, making it a better virtual-analog synthesizer (esp.
  for running sample-rates below 96KHz). (EXPERIMENTAL)
- Late optimizations to basic wave-table oscillators.
- Make sure the LV2 plugin back-end always builds first, before
  its respective LV2 UI front-end client.


0.4.0  2014-03-06  A proto-beta party.

- All knobs default value setting slightly improved.
- A run-time circumvention have been hacked, strictly related
  to when NSM session management is in charge: the native file
  browser/requester dialogs are then disabled (were taking too
  long to list the current directory on first time invocation).
- Auto-detection of the correct target library path for the
  LV2 plugin, whether it may be .../lib or .../lib64 on bi
  -arch targets, when libdir is not specified on configure
  time (--libdir=LIBDIR).
- Reverb has been added as a brand new effects stage, though
  based on good old FreeVerb :).
- Introduced a variable env.stage time control parameter.
- Dummy change-log entry for the new year.


0.3.6  2013-12-31  A fifth of a Jubilee.

- Effects/Delay BPM sync option to current transport (Auto).
- More preparations for Qt5 configure build.


0.3.5  2013-09-30  Fall greetings.

- First attempt on separating the DSP code from UI as runtime
  objects, effective for the LV2 plugin deploy.
- MIDI channel filter switch is now introduced.
- Fixed uninstall target make rule.
- Mono(phonic) mode switch is now being introduced.
- Another minor fix to note-off fast-release.


0.3.4  2013-07-16  Brand new icon ready.

- Preset file icon and mimetype now introduced.
- A brand new icon drops the lamest old-schooler's out, in a
  master lesson taught by Jarle Richard Akselsen, thanks.


0.3.3  2013-05-31  Late spring blossoming

- Some sympathy to extreme dark color (read black) schemes is
  now being indulged; some discrete changes on the icon front
  has also emerged ;)
- MIDI Key pressure/polyphonic aftertouch events now properly
  recognized, in addition to MIDI channel pressure/aftertouch
  processing.
- Parameter value ramping moved into the late post-processing,
  an attempt to reduce some pop/click artifacts even further.
- NSM support introduced to JACK client.
- A slight GUI behavior change: (re)writing existing names
  doesn't load the respective preset anymore (after ticket
  by Jiri Prochazka aka. Anchakor, thanks).
- Introducing LV2 External UI "rougue" support.
- Moog-like 24dB/oct resonant filter slight modification.
- Fixed JACK client fail/fake initialization.


0.3.2  2013-03-01  One third bug-fix release.

- Pitch-bend, Modwheel and LFO Pitch range internal fixes.
- Sustain/damper pedal switch (MIDI CC#64) support added.
- Color palette hack on Qt5 dark themes.


0.3.1  2013-02-08  One second bug-fix release.

- Improved filters parameter sensitivity (cutoff, reso).
- Envelope generators stage curves now gone a little more old-
  schooler and analog-like, hopefully improving on the punchy
  and click-less sound front.
- Experimental LV2 Time designated port support (Delay BPM).
- Preparations for Qt5 migration.


0.3.0  2012-12-21  Third coming release.

- Dropped all SSE dummy build optimization flags as they were
  making more harm than real good, performance wise.
- GUI layout moved from a toolbox into a stacked tab widget;
  also, a status-bar has been added at the bottom display.
- LV2 Atom/MIDI event processing is now official, a replacement
  for the formerly deprecated LV2 Event/MIDI specification.
- Added dirty checking also on switching from unamed presets.
- JACK stand-alone: preset loader initialization fix.


0.2.0  2012-11-22  Second public release.

- Parameters A/B comparison toggle buttons have been added.
- Keep LV2 event buffer valid on each run(), as found for strict
  LV2 specification and compliance (as suggested by falkTX).
- Increased polyphony baseline from 24 to 32 voices.
- Prepared for relative paths from preset file references.
- Velocity sensitivity configuration control has been added.
- Reset (all values to preset defaults) button has been added.
- Slight minor fix on fast-release re-triggering.
- Added some command line options to the stand-alone JACK client
  program (--help and --version information).
- Reimplemented mouse-wheel stepping on combo-dial knob widgets.
- Detached generic double-linked list class into its own header.


0.1.1  2012-09-24  One first bug-fix release.

- Fixed a crash bug on LV2 main widget close (GUI) due to some
  superfluous preset dirty checking.
- Fixed a nasty rather fundamental bug introduced by late voice
  list optimization, which was seriously crippled and noticeable
  when more than one LV2 plug-in were being instantiated.


0.1.0  2012-09-10  First true official release.

- Preset drop-down list is now sorted.
- Migrated to sourceforge.net.


0.0.9  2012-08-27  Post-vacation relax.

- Main widget now a plain basic QWidget, instead of QDialog.
- Preset salvage query check on main widget close (GUI).
- Voice list alloc/free optimization--doubled polyphony.


0.0.8  2012-07-15  Second coming consolidation.

- Proto-icon, Desktop file and Help About menus added.


0.0.7  2012-07-07  Initial change-log entry.
